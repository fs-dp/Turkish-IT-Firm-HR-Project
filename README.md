# Turkish-IT-Firm-HR-Project

As a freelance data science consultant, I had the opportunity to tackle a critical issue for a major Turkish IT firm. The project centered around a growing concern in the Turkish IT sector - employee attrition. The industry has been experiencing a significant "brain drain," with a sizable portion of skilled professionals seeking opportunities abroad, particularly in Europe and the United States. This trend has made employee retention a paramount concern for IT companies in Turkey.

My client, a prestigious Turkish IT company, approached me to develop a data-driven solution to predict and understand employee attrition in their organization. The objective was clear - to arm management with actionable insights, enabling them to identify employees who may be contemplating leaving the company and implement effective strategies to retain them.

During the project, I embarked on a structured journey divided into several tasks. I started with understanding the problem statement and the business case. Then, I moved on to importing necessary libraries and datasets, and exploring the data using visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

I then delved into the world of classifiers, specifically logistic regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest classifiers. Initially, I explored the theoretical underpinnings of these classifiers before applying them practically to the case study.

The project proceeded with the evaluation of these classifiers, their training, and performance assessment using metrics like confusion matrices and F1 scores. The final phase was a hands-on application of these concepts, where I trained, evaluated, and deployed the final model. We integrated it with the existing HR system to provide seamless and real-time insights for the management.

Here, I will be retracing the steps I took in the project using a similar dataset available on Kaggle, as confidentiality agreements prevent the use of the actual data. This dataset encapsulates factors like job involvement, education, job satisfaction, performance, relationship satisfaction, and work-life balance, mirroring the data I used for the project.

Different from the original project, I will also be demonstrating how to deploy this model as a simple app on Azure. This will give you a taste of how such a model can be operationalized in a real-world scenario, similar to integrating it into an existing system.
